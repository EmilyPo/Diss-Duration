Age’s effects on relationship duration are complex - Relationship age at time of interview usually lower for younger people, but due to a combination of ‘churn’ and not being alive long enough to have had decades-long relationships. - Age difference between ego and alter matters, but affect of age difference is likely to vary across the life course. - The effect age of age difference on relationship duration may be different depending on if the male or female is the older partner. - Which age is most important for relationship persistence? Age at beginning of relationship, or current age? - Whose age to model? Ego age? Partner age? Ego age and age difference? Dyadic Complications - Relationship duration is unlikely to be independent of other relationships each partner may be participating in. - Is there a way to represent this in a parametric regression model, and if not, what are the consequences of assuming independence between relationships? Likely other complications. "],

Let’s see if we can do better when each age cat is its own mixture model (2 lambdas and a mixture weight). Here I fit 2-component mixture models to each of the age categories and plot them as separate lines. Two models categories are displayed - a series of mixed exponential models that were fit to specific ego age categories, which when are averaged according to pop size to compare to overall K-M and other models (this means that each age category has its own two rate params (rel dur) and proportion of rels in each distribution (weight)) one mixed exponential model with two rate params that apply to all age groups, but the weight changes by age category.
