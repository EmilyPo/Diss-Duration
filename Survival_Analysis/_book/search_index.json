Method: Compare various covariate-free models with different distributions visually to Modified Kaplan-Meier. 3.1 Plots NOTE: mixed exponential was NOT fit using NSFG survey weights ## Warning in rug(dat$t_c, lwd = 0.07): some values will be clipped Now, show mixed exponential (this fit NOT using survey weights) Latent components - some rels will be short, some will be longer.

["age.html", "Chapter 4 Age 4.1 Full Dataset 4.2 Thoughts &amp; Discussions", " Chapter 4 Age This section explores exponentially distributed models that include age dynamics. Age dyanmics are particularly important for models of STIs due to the differences in reported diagnoses by age categories. Therefore it is important to represent relationships in these age cats reasonably, as duration and formation influence risk. Age’s effects on relationship duration are complex - Relationship age at time of interview usually lower for younger people, but due to a combination of ‘churn’ and not being alive long enough to have had decades-long relationships. - Age difference between ego and alter matters, but affect of age difference is likely to vary across the life course. - The effect age of age difference on relationship duration may be different depending on if the male or female is the older partner. - Which age is most important for relationship persistence? Age at beginning of relationship, or current age? - Whose age to model? Ego age? Partner age? Ego age and age difference? Dyadic Complications - Relationship duration is unlikely to be independent of other relationships each partner may be participating in. - Is there a way to represent this in a parametric regression model, and if not, what are the consequences of assuming independence between relationships? Likely other complications. 4.1 Full Dataset 4.1.1 Kaplan-Meier Visuals As we see later in this document, models that use current ego age versus those that use initial ego age differ little. Both versions of age are conceptually interesting, but graphs below show by initial age is complicated to understand in this dataset given how the data was collected. I think that initial age at rel formation would be more useful for dissolution model in ERGMS b/c you wouldn’t have to keep re-calculating dissolution probability when nodes age 4.1.2 Mixed Exp Models by Current AgeCat Mixture model across whole pop does pretty well but overestimates duration of young rels and underestmates duration of long rels. Let’s see if we can do better when each age cat is its own mixture model (2 lambdas and a mixture weight). Here I fit 2-component mixture models to each of the age categories and plot them as separate lines. Would also like to do this by initial age cat, but haven’t done so yet.
